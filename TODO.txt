# verify that the air_valve_pin matches the state of the supply_pus_pin with led
also make sure that the logic preventing writing to pin every loop is working

# Build the startup/recovery file, reset needs to reset the stored loops in the recovery file

# when reset occurs the writeToDataFile needs to handle writing a new header line

# add duration in hrs to 2nd line left column and move Pressure to third line,
move setpoint to SP on 2nd column of 3rd line


---- WORKING ON ----- 
VERIFY THE IMPLEMENTATION NOW WORKS!! 
# implement record data function. will also need a set record interval method
during setup()

use return; instead of break; in switch case to jump back to start of loop()
