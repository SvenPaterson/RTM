NOTES: This is the config file for the RTM display controller.
The controller will read in the config and update certain 
parameters for the program to run. The controller will also
update the file with the number of loops run so that the test 
can be restored after a power interruption.

The 'deltaT safety' is the allowable temperature above the
setpoint i.e. the seal is generating heat and overheating 
the chamber. It is not advisable to set this number lower 
than 5degF or 3degC otherwise your test will be interrupted
with a "Heater Runaway" warning.

If you do not wish to heat the rig head, set 'Temperature
setpoint' to 0.

DO NOT CHANGE THE TEXT PRECEEDING THE ':'!!!


Required number of loops: 100
Record data at interval(secs) of: 10
Temperature setpoint: 0
deltaT safety: 25
Temp units (1 -> degC, 0 -> degF): 0
